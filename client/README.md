Trying to get the game "Connect Four" to work as a two-player game online

Goals:
- Get to know SASS/SCSS
- Not using Bootstrap styles, only layout for this one
- Have a drop-in animation via CSS
- Working multiplayer version, with a link-generator to send someone the multiplayer link (Might be too hard)
- use and understand arrow functions


Problems:
- Check winconditional
    - idea at the moment: make rows as arrays, check for neighboring values in neighboring arrays on insertion
- Link-Generator? Difficult?
- Use big table for playing field?
